# Dog Breeds Project

This project is a simple web application that allows users to explore different dog breeds. It fetches data from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/api) to retrieve a list of dog breeds and display them on the webpage. Users can click on a breed to view a random image of a dog from that breed.
